            "Before getting a break in the field I wanted to pursue, I worked with Harmony, a monthly magazine targeted at senior citizens and an initiative from the Anil Dhirubhai Ambani Group," she said.
            <br><br>
‘’When I was not thinking of ways for branding and to boost magazine sales and advertising revenue, I was looking for a break in the film production and marketing companies.
‘’Eventually I got that break and joined Culture Brandz in their film marketing division.  I worked on few films such as Azaan, Tukka Fit before the entrepreneurial bug bit my colleague Ritesh Kudecha in 2012 and together we started Hash Entertainment.’’
